xpnote = \markup { \override #'(line-width . 90) \justify { \bold \italic "Fifteen Inventions" is a modular, multi-movement work for piano. The inventions are organized into seven, three-movement groups called sequences. These sequences can be played in any combination. I constructed each of the short inventions from one to seven contrapuntal strands. Inventions which share the same number of these strands are composed out in a similar fashion, and thus share a title. }}
