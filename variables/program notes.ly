At the start of 2022, I composed a short piece for piano constructed from descending
diatonic scales and the 15 partitions of the 7-pitch diatonic set. This invention
would inspire me to write more inventions. These \bold \italic "Fifteen Inventions"
correspond to one of the 15 partitions and, as such, have between 1 and 7 strands or
voices.
