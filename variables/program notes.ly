%fifteen inventions project

xpnote = \markup { \override #'(line-width . 90) \justify { At the start of 2022, I composed a short piece for piano constructed from descending diatonic scales and the 15 partitions of the 7-pitch diatonic set. This invention would inspire me to write 14 more inventions. These \bold \italic "Fifteen Inventions" correspond to one of the 15 partitions and, as such, have between 1 and 7 strands or voices. Many of these inventions imbricate partitions of the diatonic set and 12-tone aggregates. Inventions with the same number of strands or voices share titles and musical characters. I borrowed terms from plant morphology I felt describe these musical characters for the titles. }}
